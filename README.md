# PHP Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Ahh Feels like ages :). During my practice sessions for PHP OOP, here are some things I learnt!

## Classes
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

## Objects
- An object is an instance of a class. 
- Objects have member variables and have behavior associated with them. 
- Access the member variables and functions of an object through the use of the arrow (->) operator.

## Inheritance
- Inheritance is a mechanism of acquiring the properties and behaviors of a parent class by a child class. 
- Child class inherits all public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. 
- Common use of polymorphism in OOP: parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

## Abstraction
- Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential features of the object. 
- Achieve abstraction in PHP by declaring class as abstract and providing only method signatures (no body).

## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is wrapping data and functions into a single unit (object). 
- Achieve encapsulation in PHP by declaring all class variables as private and providing public methods to access and manipulate these variables.

## Interfaces
- An interface is a blueprint for classes. 
- Defines methods that a class must implement. 
- An interface cannot be instantiated and must be implemented by a class.
